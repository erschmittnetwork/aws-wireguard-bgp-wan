      AWS • WireGuard • BGP • Automation • High Availability
    </div>

    <p>
      This site hosts a production-style networking lab demonstrating the design,
      implementation, and validation of a secure, highly available WAN built on AWS.
    </p>

    <p>
      The project implements a hub-and-spoke architecture using WireGuard as the encrypted
      underlay and BGP as the dynamic routing overlay. High availability is achieved through
      AWS-native automation that performs deterministic hub failover using Elastic IP
      reassociation, EventBridge, and Lambda.
    </p>

    <p>
      The lab emphasizes enterprise-aligned design principles including underlay/overlay
      separation, deterministic routing behavior, automated recovery, and operational
      observability. All architecture, validation, and runbook documentation is maintained
      as code and published automatically using GitHub Actions, Pandoc, and CloudFront-backed
      S3 hosting.
    </p>
